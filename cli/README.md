Rust crate for interfacing with Linux GPIO character devices.
This crate contains command-line tools based on gpiod library:

- `gpio` - based on std sync runtime
- `tgpio` - base on [tokio](https://tokio.rs/) async runtime
- `agpio` - based on [async-std](https://async.rs/) async runtime

It provides an interface to the Linux GPIO using the chardev module.
This interface involves calling [ioctl](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/ioctl.2.html) funcions which are unsafe and require some unintuitive variable mapping.
To ease this process, this crate provides a [Chip] struct which encapsulates the interface in safe Rust functions.
The functionality provided here is highly inspired by [libgpiod](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/libs/libgpiod/libgpiod.git/).

Since all functionality is dependent on Linux function calls, this crate only compiles for Linux systems.

## ABI compatibility

Both ABI v1 (linux >= 4.0) and v2 (linux >= v5.10) supported but edge detection implemented for v2 only.
Deprecated sysfs-based API (linux < 4.0) currently is not supported at all.

## Crates

- [gpiod-core](https://crates.io/crates/gpiod-core) - core abstractions and low level interface (not for end users)
- [gpiod](https://crates.io/crates/gpiod) - sync interface which supports synchronous operation only
- [tokio-gpiod](https://crates.io/crates/tokio-gpiod) - async interface for [tokio](https://tokio.rs/) fans
- [async-std-gpiod](https://crates.io/crates/async-std-gpiod) - async interface for [async-std](https://async.rs/) fans

## Usage examples

Detect chips:
```sh
$ gpio detect
gpiochip0 [pinctrl-bcm2711] (58 lines)
gpiochip1 [raspberrypi-exp-gpio] (8 lines)
gpiochip2 [ftdi-cbus] (4 lines)
```

Get chip info:
```sh
$ gpio info gpiochip0
gpiochip0 [pinctrl-bcm2711] (58 lines)
